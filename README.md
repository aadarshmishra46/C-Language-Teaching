## 🗓️ *1-Month C Programming Plan for Beginners*

### ✅ *Learning Objective*:  
By the end of this month, the student should be able to:
- Understand programming basics
- Write, compile, and debug basic C programs
- Use variables, loops, conditionals, and functions effectively

---

## 📆 *Week 1: Getting Started with C*

### 🔑 *Concepts*:

- What is C? History and applications
- Installing compiler (GCC / Code::Blocks / Turbo C)
- Structure of a C program
- Writing and running the first program: Hello, World!
- Comments and code readability
- Variables and Data Types (int, float, char)
- Basic Input/Output: printf() and scanf()

### 💻 *Practice Programs*:
- Print your name, age, marks
- Add two numbers
- Calculate area of a circle

---

## 📆 *Week 2: Control Flow & Operators*

### 🔑 *Concepts*:
- Arithmetic, relational, logical, assignment operators
- Conditional statements:
  - if, if-else, nested if-else, switch
- goto, break, continue

### 💻 *Practice Programs*:
- Even or odd number
- Find the greatest of three numbers
- Menu-based calculator
- Vowel or consonant checker

---

## 📆 *Week 3: Loops, Arrays, and Strings*

### 🔑 *Concepts*:
- for, while, do-while loops
- Loop control: break, continue
- Introduction to Arrays (1D)
- Basic String operations (using char arrays)
  - Reading strings with scanf() / gets()
  - strlen(), strcpy(), strcat()

### 💻 *Practice Programs*:
- Multiplication table
- Sum of digits
- Array sum and average
- Reverse a string
- Check if a string is palindrome

---

## 📆 *Week 4: Functions and Intro to Pointers*

### 🔑 *Concepts*:
- Functions: declaration, definition, calling
- Function with parameters and return values
- Recursion (e.g., factorial, Fibonacci)
- Introduction to pointers (&, *)
- Pointer and variable relationship

### 💻 *Practice Programs*:
- Factorial of a number (recursive & iterative)
- Fibonacci series
- Swapping two numbers (with and without pointers)
- Prime number check using function

---

## 📚 *Weekly Review & Mini Test*
- At the end of each week:
  - Quick recap of concepts
  - 3–5 small coding questions for revision
